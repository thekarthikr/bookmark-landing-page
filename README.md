# Bookmark Landing Page

This is a solution to the [Bookmark Landing Page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/bookmark-landing-page-5d0b588a9edda32581d29158) challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). 

The challenge is to build a responsive landing page for a bookmarking application. The page includes a header section, a features section, a download section, a testimonials section, a frequently asked questions section, and a footer section. 

I used HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to create this solution.
